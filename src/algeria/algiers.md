### Martyrs’ Memorial
The Martyr’s Memorial Monument on the hills overlooking Algiers is often considered to be one of the best places to visit in Algeria. If you only gone visit one site during your visit to the city, this is one of the things to do in Algiers.

The Martyr’s Memorial is located just above the Botanical Garden Hamma and the National Art Museum (Le Musee National Des Beaux-Arts).
